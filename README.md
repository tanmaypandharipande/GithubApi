# GithubApi
This project has MVP Structure.
It is to use the GitHub /users API.
At the start there is login page, in which the user enters his GitHub Credentials. (Currently I have used static Auth token).
Later using Basic Auth we are accessing the /users API by logging in.
This api accepts per-page record, 200 is passed for now and also from which ID you want the user list from.
After the users list get loaded, you can search using the search icon on basis of the login name.
Clone the repository and build the project.
You can now run on your phone.
Minimum SDK version is 16.
